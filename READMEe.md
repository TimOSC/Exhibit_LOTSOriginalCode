Exhibit_LOTSOriginalCode
========================

This is the code and subsequent changes for LOTS based off what Jeff handed to me when I redid the table wiring

It should be noted that for what ever reason the WaveShield only works if the code is uploaded using Arduino 1.0.3. 
There is also a library that needs to be added to this version of Arduino's Libraries folder named "WaveHC" I am going to
add this library to this repository, but please not it will need to be pulled out of the sketch folder and added to the 
Libraries folder for it to work.
